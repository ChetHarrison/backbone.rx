Backbone.Rx
===========
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ChetHarrison/backbone.rx/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ChetHarrison/backbone.rx)

Backbone.Rx adds [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) message streams to
Backbone. This is essentially modified of [Backbone.Radio](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.radio/blob/master/src/backbone.radio.js)
which is based on Backbone.Events.

At the moment this is a **work in progress**. For milestones see the
`todo` file.
